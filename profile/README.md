<h4 align="left">rasGPT | áˆ«áˆµ - Building the First Ethiopian LLM Model<br><br>Welcome to rasGPT, an open-source organization dedicated to building the first Ethiopian LLM (Large Language Model) that supports Amharic (AMH), Oromo (ORO), and Tigrigna (TIG) languages. Our goal is to create a cutting-edge NLP tool that will benefit professionals, researchers, and anyone interested in Ethiopian language-based LLMs.<br><br>Project Overview:<br><br>The rasGPT project involves the development of a language model that can understand and generate natural language text in the AMH, ORO, and TIG languages. The model will be trained on a large corpus of legal text data, including books, legal documents, and scholarly articles, to enable it to analyze and interpret local languages.<br><br>The LLM model will be based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, a state-of-the-art NLP model that has been successfully used in various language tasks, such as language translation, question-answering, and text generation.<br><br>How to Contribute:<br><br>We welcome contributions from anyone interested in the project, regardless of their level of experience. There are many ways to get involved, including:<br><br>Data Collection and Pre-processing: We need help collecting and pre-processing text data in AMH, ORO, and TIG languages. This involves scraping websites, cleaning and normalizing text data, and preparing it for training the LLM model.<br><br>Model Training and Fine-tuning: We need experts in NLP and machine learning to help us train and fine-tune the LLM model. This involves using libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and HuggingFace to implement the GPT architecture, fine-tune the model, and optimize its performance.<br><br>Testing and Evaluation: We need help testing and evaluating the LLM model to ensure that it meets our quality standards. This involves designing test sets, measuring the model's accuracy and performance, and providing feedback for further improvement.<br><br>Documentation and Outreach: We need help documenting our progress and sharing it with the wider community. This involves writing documentation, creating tutorials and demos, and promoting the project through social media and other channels.<br><br>To get started, please check out our contribution guidelines and code of conduct. We use GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to track our progress and coordinate our efforts. You can also join our Telegram group to connect with other contributors and get help with any questions or issues you may have.<br><br>Acknowledgments:<br><br>We would like to thank the open-source community for their contributions to the NLP and machine learning fields, and for providing the tools and resources we need to build the rasGPT project. We would also like to acknowledge the importance of promoting linguistic diversity and empowering low resource languages such as AMH, ORO, and TIG. Together, we can build a better future for NLP and education in Ethiopia and beyond with our nativity intiative.</h4>
